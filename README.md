# OCEL2.0_Research
Hello
This Branch provides all of the necessary CSV files to import and test for Neo4j's Large event logs. 


These event logs that came from the CSV files are not made by me.
They are from this website, which is based on Procure-to-Pay.
A description of the scenario is also provided here. 
They are made by the Chair of Process and Data Science, RWTH Aachen University
