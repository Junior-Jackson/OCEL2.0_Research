# OCEL2.0_Research
This Branch provides all of the necessary CSV files to import and test for Neo4j's Large event logs. 

I did not make these event logs that came from the CSV files. They are from this website "https://www.ocel-standard.org/event-logs/overview/", which is based on Procure-to-Pay. The scenarios (and subsequently the event logs) are made by Gyunam Park and Leah Tacke genannt Unterberg, from the Chair of Process and Data Science, RWTH Aachen University.
